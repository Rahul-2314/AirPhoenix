					ðŸŒ¸We rally university students behind a single mission: to do
					something that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matters.
					<br></br>
					ðŸŒ¸Students leverage our community and resources to work with startups,
					or launch &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ventures/projects of their
					own.
					<br></br>ðŸŒ¸And it all starts with our cohort: A 4 week program that
					leads to Fellowship with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catalyst.
					<br></br>ðŸŒ¸This community offers a home to students who are
					disenchanted by "traditional"
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paths, and who are interested in
					building things.<br></br>ðŸŒ¸By opening the door to entrepreneurship, we
					believe we can 10x a student's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future income, skills, and wisdom. They
					just have to do the work.
